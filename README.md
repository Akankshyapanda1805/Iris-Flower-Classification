# Iris Flower Classification 🌸

This project is a Flask-based web application that uses Machine Learning to classify Iris flowers into Setosa, Virginica, or Versicolor based on sepal and petal measurements. The model is built using Decision Tree Regressor and deployed with Flask for user interaction.

## 🚀 Features:
✅ Train & save an ML model (model.pkl)

✅ Predict Iris species using a web form

✅ Flask-based UI with Bootstrap styling

🔹 Tech Stack: Python, Flask, scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

This project is a Machine Learning-powered web application that classifies Iris flowers into three species:

Setosa (0)

Virginica (1)

Versicolor (2)

The model is trained using a Decision Tree Regressor and deployed as a Flask web app where users can enter flower measurements to predict the species.
